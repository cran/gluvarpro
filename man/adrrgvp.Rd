%%  ~~function to do ... ~~
}
\description{
Average daily risk range is a measure of glycemic risk that is based on risk values obtained from glucose levels that are mathematically transformed to give equal weight to hyperglycemic and hypoglycemic excursions. The \emph{adrrgvp} is scored based on risk categories: Low risk, [0,20); moderate risk, [20,40); and high risk, 40 and above.
