\title{blood glucose index
%%  ~~function to do ... ~~
}
\description{
Blood glucose index is a measure of glycemic risk based on the same normalizing transformation as the \emph{adrrgvp} measure but is specifically designed to be sensitive to hypoglycemia (\emph{lbgi}) and hyperglycemia (\emph{hbgi}), respectively, and to have zero correlation with their opposite ranges on the blood glucose scale. The \emph{lbgi} and \emph{hbgi} are scored based on risk categories: Low risk, [0,2.5); moderate risk, [2.5,5); and high risk, 5 and above.
