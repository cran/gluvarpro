\title{area under curve
%%  ~~function to do ... ~~
}
\description{
Area under curve is an average measure of glycemia that quantifies the average exposure to hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia events. The integral trapezoidal cumulative function is used to calculate the area. The area under a curve between two points can be found by doing a definite integral between the two points. To find the area under the curve y = f(x) between x = a and x = b, integrate y = f(x) between the limits of a and b.
